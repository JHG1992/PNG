    <h1>Coffee Information</h1>
    <p><strong>Origin:</strong> Simbai, Papa New Guinea</p>
    <p><strong>What We Taste:</strong> Caramel, Cocoa Nibs, Stone Fruit, Passion Fruit</p>
    <p><strong>Process:</strong> Washed</p>
    <p><strong>Farm Info:</strong> Papa New Guinea boasts fertile volcanic soil for growing Arabica coffee, but its mountainous terrain makes transportation challenging. Remote villages and smallholder coffee farms, comprising 85% of the country's coffee production, are accessible only by foot or light aircraft. Air travel plays a crucial role in moving goods, Simbai Balus Kopi, sourced from the Simbai region near the Bismarck Range, is a prime example. Volcafe PNH, a sister company, collaborates with over 4,000 farmers in this isolated area, utilizing four airstrips to provide essential support.</p>
